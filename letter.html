<p>Dear Dr. Mansoor,</p>

<p>I hope this letter finds you well.</p>
<p> I am writing to express my growing concern about the security measures currently in place at our college.</p>
<p> As a dedicated student, I deeply value the safe and supportive environment that our institution strives to provide.</p>
<p> However, recent incidents on campus have raised significant apprehensions among the student body regarding our overall security.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, there have been reports of unauthorized individuals gaining access to our campus facilities.</p>
<p> Additionally, several students, including myself, have observed areas around the campus where lighting is inadequate, making these spots potentially dangerous during the evening hours.</p>
<p> These issues have understandably led to a heightened sense of vulnerability among students.</p>

<p>I kindly request a meeting with you or the appropriate security personnel to discuss these concerns and potential solutions further.</p>
<p> I am confident that, together, we can create a more secure and reassuring environment for everyone at college.</p>

<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,<br></p>
